# Business  Understanding
The purpose of this project is to generate a model that produces the the probability of a listing being reserved based on the features the listing has. This tool can be useful for an airbnb host who would like to know if there listing has a chance of being booked or not.

# Data
This data comes from the Inside Airbnb website, which is an open source tool for airbnb listings all over the world. I will be focusing on the dataset for NYC. In this dataset it contains around 36,923 rows (listings) and 74 columns (features). Below is a link to the data.

#### Metric
My target I will be looking at the 'has_availability' column to see if the a listing is available to be booked or not. For this project my target is binary so I will be working with classifiaction models. For my metric I will be looking at accuracy and precision. For accuracy I will be looing how accurate my models are preforming and for precision I will be looking how well my model is correctly predicting if my listing has availability to be booked or not.
